# Flappy Bird Clone in C (Console-Based)

A simple **Flappy Bird Clone** written in C, using ASCII graphics for a minimalistic game experience. This project demonstrates basic **game physics, event handling, and collision detection** without requiring any external graphics libraries.

## Features
- üê¶ **Simple ASCII Graphics** - Runs in the terminal.
- üéÆ **Basic Physics** - Gravity and jump mechanics.
- üöß **Procedural Pipes** - Randomly generated obstacles.
- üéØ **Score Tracking** - Survive as long as possible!
- üî• **No External Libraries Required** - Works with pure C.
